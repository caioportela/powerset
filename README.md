# Power set

A   set   is a collection (container) of certain values, without any particular order, and no repeated values.

It corresponds with a finite set in mathematics.

A set can be implemented as an associative array (partial mapping) in which the value of each key-value pair is ignored.

Given a set S, the power set (or powerset) of S, written P(S), or 2S, is the set of all subsets of S.
